module Checken
  # The user proxy class sits on top of a user and provides the methods that
  # checken needs. You can write your own proxy or use the default. If you use
  # the default you'll need to make sure that the users you provide implement
  # the methods this proxy will call.
  #
  # All interactions between checken and a user will happen via a proxy. This
  # default class is a useful benchmark list of how your user should behave.
